\chapter{Proposed Contributions and Project Plan}\label{C:plan}

\section{Proposed Contributions}

In the previous chapter, some preliminary work has been done to investigaete the performances of direct representation and indirect representation on the proposed PSO-based approach and GP-based approach respectively. We have shown that those two approaches outperform some recent existing EC-based approaches using our proposed comprehensive quality evaluation model. To carry a further research on the remaining subbjective for objective one and the rest three objectives outlined in the proposal, we present the proposed contribution and project plan to guide the research direction for the thesis in this chapter.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item This thesis will develop a new fully automated semantic web service composition approach for simultaneously optimising the quality of semantic matchmaking and QoS. We expect that more effective and efficient methods for handling novel combinatorial optimisation problem for semantic web service composition, which is done by relying on effective representations, a comprehensive quality model and a motivated EC-based method with local search or AI planning techniques.

\item This thesis will extend on previous multi-objective web service composition approach to effectively and efficiently explore the Pareto front of comprehensive quality-aware service composition. Apart from that, conditional constraints in SLA and customised matchmaking level is expected to handle conditional constraints on each independent objectives in comprehensive quality mode. Simutenaneouly taking all these necessary requirements is not considered in any past research. 

\item This thesis will develop an effective and efficient EC-based hybrid approach for dynamic web service composition problem. This approach is expected to better handle composition environment changes. In particular, the changes of QoS, Ontology and service repository (i.e., service failure and new service registration). These changes are not fully studied in the past and solved using motivated EC-based approaches.

\item This thesis will develop EC-based hybrid approaches to a more complex and realistic semantic web service composition based on not only inputs and outputs, but preconditions and postconditions. We expected a general mechanism is developed for supporting all the service composition constructs. Those occasionally considered precondition and postconditions are not fully studied for supporting all the composition constructs and not employed in a fully automated approach either.

\section{Thesis Outline}

The following is an outline of the PhD thesis,  in which Chapter 6 may be replaced by Chapter 7 since it is an optimal objective.

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textit{Chapter 1: Introduction}\\
 This chapter covers a problem statement, motivations, research goals, contributions, and organisation of the thesis.
 \item \textit{Chapter 2: Literature Review}\\
This chapter initially provides some fundamental concepts for demonstrating the background of service composition. followed, a comprehensive understanding and analysing of existing work on the web service composition.  In particular, four research directions for web service composition are investigated: single-objective approach, multi-objective approach, dynamic service composition and semantic web service composition.  However, the techniques are mainly focused on EC-based approaches
 \item \textit{Chapter 3: A Hybrid Approach to comprehensive Quality-Aware Web Service Composition}\\
This chapter will introduce new and effective hybrid approaches that combine EC-based techniques and other searching methods. These approaches are developed to effective and efficient handle comprehensive quality-aware service composition problems. Apart from that, the performance of different direct/indirect representations is also investigated here.
 \item \textit{Chapter 4: Develop Multi-Objective Approaches to Comprehensive Quality-Aware Semantic Service Composition}\\
This chapter will demonstrate our multi-objective approaches, which optimises every quality criteria of comprehensive quality independently for automated semantic web service composition. Constraints on SLA and customised matchmaking levels are also considered in the multi-objective approaches.
 \item \textit{Chapter 5: Develop hybrid techniques to support dynamic semantic web service composition effectively}\\
This chapter will discuss effective hybrid approaches for dynamic semantic web service composition. Effective and efficient EC-based hybrid methods are developed to handle service composition problems regarding the changes in QoS and Ontology and service repository (i.e., service failure new service registration). Those approaches are compared with existing dynamic service composition approaches, which do not utilise EC techniques.
 \item \textit{Chapter 6: Develop hybrid approaches for semantic web service compositions based on preconditions and effects}\\
This chapter will discuss semantic service composition problems by utilising a proposed matchmaking mechanism of preconditions and postconditions, which fully support different composition constructs, such as loop and choice. These problems will be approached by EC-based hybrid methods focusing on improving their performance in both effectiveness and efficiency.
 \item \textit{Chapter 7: Conclusions and Future Work}\\
This chapter concludes all the contributions made by the developed approaches in each objective. In addition, the limitations are also pointed along with the future research directions.
\end{itemize}
