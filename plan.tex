\chapter{Proposed Contributions and Project Plan}\label{C:plan}

\section{Proposed Contributions}

In the previous chapter, some preliminary work has been done to the investigation the performances of direct representation and indirect representation on the proposed PSO-based approach and GP-based approach respectively. We have shown that those two approaches outperform some recent existing EC-based approaches using our proposed comprehensive quality model for evaluation. In addition to carrying a further research on the first objective, the rest three objectives outlined in the proposal will be investigated. This chapter presents the proposed contribution and project plan to guide the research direction for the thesis.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item This thesis will develop a new fully automated semantic web service composition approach for simultaneously optimising the quality of semantic matchmaking and QoS. This is expected to be more effective and efficient at handling combinatorial optimisation problem in service composition, which is done by relying on a most effective representation, a comprehensive quality model and a motivated EC-based method with local search or AI planning techniques.

\item This thesis will extend on previous many-objective web service composition approach to effective and efficient explore the Pareto front of comprehensive quality-aware service composition. Apart from that, conditional constraints in SLA and customised matchmaking level is expected to handle conditional constraints on each independent objectives in comprehensive quality mode. Simutenaneouly taking all these necessary requirements is not considered in any past research. 

\item This thesis will develop an effective and efficient EC-based hybrid approach for dynamic web service composition problem. This approach is expected to better handle composition environment changes. In particular, the changes of QoS, Ontology and service repository (i.e., service failure and new service registration). These changes are not fully studied in the past and solved using the EC-based approach in the research area.

\item This thesis will develop EC-based hybrid approaches to a more complex and realistic semantic web service composition based on not only inputs and outputs, but precondition and postcondition. This is expected to develop a general mechanism for supporting all the service composition constructs. Those occasionally considered precondition and postconditions are not fully studied for supporting all the composition constructs and not employed in a fully automated approach either.

\section{Thesis Outline}

The following is an outline of the PhD thesis,  in which Chapter 6 may be replaced by Chapter 7 since it is an optimal objective.

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textit{Chapter 1: Introduction}\\
 This chapter covers a problem statement, motivations, research goals, contributions, and organisation of the thesis.
 \item \textit{Chapter 2: Literature Review}\\
This chapter initially provides some fundamental concepts for demonstrating the background of service composition. followed, a comprehensive understanding and analysing of existing work on the web service composition.  In particular, four research directions for web service composition are investigated: single-objective approach, multi-objective approach, dynamic service composition and semantic web service composition.  However, the techniques are mainly focused on EC-based approaches
 \item \textit{Chapter 3: A Hybrid Approach to comprehensive Quality-Aware Web Service Composition}\\
This chapter will introduce new and effective hybrid approaches that combine EC-based techniques and another searching methods. These approaches are developed to effective and efficient handle comprehensive quality-aware service composition problems. Apart from that, the performance of different direct/indirect representations is also investigated here.
 \item \textit{Chapter 4: Develop Multi-Objective Approaches to Comprehensive Quality-Aware Semantic Service Composition}\\
This chapter will demonstrate our multi-objective approaches, which optimises every quality criteria of comprehensive quality independently for automated semantic web service composition. Constraints on SLA and customised matchmaking levels are also considered in the multi-objective approaches.
 \item \textit{Chapter 5: Develop hybrid techniques to support dynamic semantic web service composition effectively}\\
 %A novel semantic approach for selecting which services are to be included in the composition will be proposed in this chapter. This approach focuses on selecting candidate services to be used in a planning-based composition technique without relying on precalculated semantic distances, as existing approaches have done. A comparison will be performed between this novel approach and the those that rely on precalculations.
 \item \textit{Chapter 6: Develop hybrid approaches for semantic web service compositions based on preconditions and effects}\\
 %This chapter will extend the composition technique discussed throughout this thesis to work in dynamic environments. Firstly, a way of re-optimising solutions as quality values fluctuate will be proposed, and then an approach for responding to service faults will be discussed. The extended technique will be compared against the existing dynamic composition approaches, which do not use EC techniques, to establish whether there are quality gains in the solutions produced.
 \item \textit{Chapter 7: Conclusions and Future Work}\\
 %In this chapter, conclusions will be drawn from the analysis and experiments conducted in the different phases of this research, and the main findings for each one of them will be summarised. Additionally, future research directions will be discussed.

\section{Resources Required}

\subsection{Computing Resources}
An experimental approach will be adopted in this research, entailing the execution of experiments that are likely to be computationally expensive. The ECS Grid computing facilities can be used to complete these experiments within reasonable time frames, thus meeting this requirement.

\subsection{Library Resources}
The majority of the material relevant to this research can be found online, using the university's electronic resources. Other works may either be acquired at the university's library, or by soliciting assistance from the Subject Librarian for the fields of engineering and computer science.

\subsection{Conference Travel Grants}
Publications to relevant venues in this field are expected throughout this project, therefore travel grants from the university are required for key conferences.
