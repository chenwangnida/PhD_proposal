\begin{abstract}
\small{Automated Web service composition is an NP-hard problem and it has been raising much attention in the research community due to the computational challenge and real-world applicability. Existing works either optimize QoS or semantic matchmaking quality, or are semi-automated approaches. The focus of our studies on service composition is to find effective and efficient approaches to comprehensive quality-aware semantic Web service composition, which aims to optimize semantic matchmaking quality and Quality of service (QoS) simultaneously. We will address this problem by achieving the following objectives: (1) developing EC-based approaches that explicitly support the comprehensive quality, (2) developing multi-objective approaches for optimizing the quality criteria involved in the comprehensive quality, (3) developing EC-based  composition approaches for dynamic service composition while handling various changes of composition environment, and  (4) developing EC-based approaches for semantic Web service composition supporting precondition and effects. In our preliminary work, we developed two EC-based approaches to single-objective comprehensive quality-aware automated semantic web service composition.}
